# Dotfile structure

3 different folders contain the configuration for Will's dotfiles.

- `personal/`
- `work/`
- `misc/`
- server/

With both the personal and work, these are set up for Linux. The idea is to run a script that will set up symplink from the home directory (or `.config/`) to the Dotfiles repo. Execute a script to setup.

## WSL

- Make sure to have WSL in mirrored mode
- Make sure to use or not use system d in building/linking
-

## Neovim

Install Neovim using homebrew to get the latest version

### Neovim with VSCode

Keybindings should be set up to be similar, don't worry too much about this. Only use vscode when you really need to.

## Tmux

- Clone tpm (tmux plugin manager) before using tmux

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Make sure to fetch the plugins for tmux, can be done by pressing

```
C-Space + I
```

- Make sure to hit shift+i to make it capital...
