# Dotfile structure
3 different folders contain the configuration for Will's dotfiles.
- `personal/`
- `work/`
- `misc/`

With both the personal and work, these are set up for Linux. The idea is to run a script that will set up symplink from the home directory (or `.config/`) to the Dotfiles repo. Execute a script to setup.
