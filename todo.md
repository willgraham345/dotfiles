# DONE

- [x] Add in bullet for markdown files (sorta finished, still needs confirmation that it is working in markdown)
- [x] Add in link for Windows desktop to work and personal .zshrc's
  - I don't think this is needed anymore. We can just use zoxide for skipping around
- [x] Add in dependency for pgAdmin4
  - There's a docker container for this, I don't need it...
- [x] Add commands for pandoc between word and md
  - This is easier than I thought to just do from command line
- [ ] Fix query for dataviewJS within a project
      (<https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-apt/>)
- [x] Try octo
  - Octo only works for github

# TODO

- [ ] Set up LuaSnip to add in VSCode snippets, and especially mermaid snippets
- [ ] Add in support for Obsidian from neovim
