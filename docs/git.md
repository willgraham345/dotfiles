There are two .gitconfig files:
1. Work (named .gitconfig.work)
2. Personal (named .gitconfig.personal)

On them, they use different methods of authenticating and determining how the configuration is mapped. Use gh auth login for the personal one (authentication keys are great), and ssh keys for the work one.
